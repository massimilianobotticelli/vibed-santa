# Secret Santa Configuration Template
# Copy this file to .appconfig.yaml and modify it with your actual groups and participants
# This file supports multiple families or friend groups with independent Secret Santa assignments

# Family/Group configurations
# You can define multiple groups (families, friend groups, office teams, etc.)
# Each group has its own:
# - Unique ID (used internally)
# - Display name (shown to users)
# - Budget (gift spending limit)
# - Participants (with usernames, passwords, names, and exclusions)

families:
  # Example Group 1: A Family
  - id: smith_family
    name: Smith Family
    budget: 50
    participants:
      # Each participant needs:
      # - username: unique login identifier (no spaces, lowercase recommended)
      # - password: secure password for login (use strong passwords in production!)
      # - name: display name shown in the app
      # - exclude: list of usernames this person should NOT be assigned to
      #   Common exclusions: spouses, partners, siblings, or anyone living together

# Configuration Notes:
# 1. Copy this file to .appconfig.yaml before using the app
# 2. Replace all example IDs, names, usernames, and passwords with real data
# 3. Use STRONG passwords - these control access to Secret Santa assignments!
# 4. Each group ID must be unique (e.g., smith_family, friends_2025, office_marketing)
# 5. Usernames must be unique across ALL groups
# 6. Ensure usernames in exclude lists match exactly with actual usernames
# 7. You can add or remove groups and participants as needed
# 8. The exclude list prevents awkward pairings (spouses, partners, siblings, roommates)
# 9. Each group operates independently with its own Secret Santa assignments
# 10. Language selection is done by users in the app interface (not configured here)
