# This file contains participant information for the Secret Santa application

# Budget for gifts (in your preferred currency)
# Set this to the agreed-upon gift budget for your group
budget: 50

# Participants with their login credentials
# Each participant needs:
# - username: unique login identifier (no spaces, lowercase recommended)
# - password: secure password for login (use strong passwords in production)
# - name: display name for the participant
# - exclude: list of usernames this person should NOT be assigned to give gifts to
#   Common exclusions: spouses, siblings, close family members, or recent past assignments

participants:
  # Example participant 1

  # Example participant 2

    password: change_me_456
    name: "Second Person"
    exclude: [user1]  # Cannot give to user1 (e.g., spouse)

    exclude: [user5, user7]  # Cannot give to user5 (sibling) or user7 (partner)

    password: change_me_mno
    name: "Eighth Person"
    exclude: []  # Can give to anyone

# Configuration Notes:
# 1. Copy this file to .appconfig.yaml before use
# 2. Replace all example usernames, passwords, and names with real data
# 3. Use strong passwords for security
# 4. Ensure usernames in exclude lists match exactly with actual usernames
# 5. You can add or remove participants as needed
# 6. The exclude list helps prevent awkward gift exchanges (spouses, siblings, etc.)
